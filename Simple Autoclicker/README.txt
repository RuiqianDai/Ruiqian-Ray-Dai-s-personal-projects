This autoclicker allows the user to automate mouse actions, and was created for use in single player games, but you are free to find other creative uses for the program.

That being said, do not use this to cheat in multiplayer games or engage in other wrongful conducts.
The program does not attempt to hide its actions and will be detected by anti-cheat software.

The program is written in Python, and would require Python being installed on the local machine in order to run. 
A .exe file is not provided for transparency (since this project was created due to me not wanting to download random .exe files off the internet).

Have fun.
